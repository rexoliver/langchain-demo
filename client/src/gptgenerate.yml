# ChatGPT, please create me the necessary react and yml components to create a single page chat application. 
# I will specify the components and general ideas needed to create the project via this yml definitions
# This is a React Typescript application. 
# The general Idea is to create a chatbox like application. The only setup I have is the standard react typescript frontend using Vite, 
# So extra stuff will be needed. Please suggest what Else I will be needing for the application.

# Ok looks good, but I have a lot of criticisms: 
# Text does not show up correctly in Text box during browser dark mode. I think the black is overriding the text, making it hard to see. 
# The Text that the user inputs will need to accomodate dark mode. 
# Also, The chatbox is small and to the left side of the page. It should be centered and near the top. Chatbox should be longer so users can see longer input.

######### QUERY 3 ##########################

# Criticisms:  Would like chatbox locked at the bottom instead. Box  also needs to be wider and centered, it is still put to the left side of the page. 
# Additions: Below the chatbox, I would like this notice: "RexGPT April 10 Version. Output is not filtered, expect some NSFW content."  
# Additions: Above the chatbox, in a scrollable window, I would like a scrollable area that displays each user input that was sent. 
# Additions: In the same scrollable window, I would like a test response to be below each corresponding user input saying, "RexGPT has heard you."
# Please tell me how I can do this. 

# QUERY 4: Query 3 was cut off, so I prompted it to print the rest
